# EverDaft Kata

This is a legacy code exercise based on the [EverCraft
Kata](https://github.com/guyroyse/evercraft-kata). An existing code base has
been created in an assortment of languages. The existing code bases have
implemented the code up through Iteration 2. It might even work but were not
sure as unit test coverage is spotty.

So, Pick a language and get started.
